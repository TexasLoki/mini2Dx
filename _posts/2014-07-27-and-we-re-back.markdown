As many people noticed, we were hacked about two weeks ago and the website was down. Having only worked ever on internal servers, it's been a good lesson in server security. I also took the opportunity to improve/change some things on the website.

**mini2dx.org on Github**

The main website is now hosted on Github using [Jekyll][jekyll-gh]. This will make things easier to manage and will allow the community to submit merge requests to update the website. Hopefully this will encourage some tutorials, blog posts and documentation contributions from the community.

**downloads.mini2dx.org**

All mini2Dx downloads are now hosted at <a href="http://downloads.mini2dx.org">downloads.mini2dx.org</a>. This will help people quickly get downloads.

**javadoc.mini2dx.org**

All mini2Dx javadocs are now hosted at <a href="http://javadoc.mini2dx.org">javadoc.mini2dx.org</a>.

**maven.mini2dx.org**

I've moved the Maven repository hosting to <a href="http://maven.mini2dx.org">maven.mini2dx.org</a>.

**Forums -> Reddit**

Since most people have been defaulting to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mini2Dx">our Reddit page</a> for questions instead of the forums I'm moving all community interactions to there.

In other news I've begun pushing towards 1.0.0 of mini2Dx. I'll be writing another blog post later this week detailing some of the coming changes and the plans for release. In the meantime, if you want to contribute any tutorials or documentation feel free to make a merge request to our gh-pages branch or contibute to the wiki.
